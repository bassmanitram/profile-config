   ```

## Development Workflow

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=profile_config --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest profile_config/tests/test_resolver.py

pytest -m "not slow"
```

### Code Quality

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format code
black profile_config/ examples/

# Sort imports
isort profile_config/ examples/

# Lint code
flake8 profile_config/ examples/

# Type checking
mypy profile_config/
```

### Running Examples

Test your changes with the provided examples:

```bash
python examples/basic_usage.py
python examples/advanced_profiles.py
python examples/web_app_config.py
python examples/toml_usage.py
```
